## Description

## User Story

As an event organizer
I want to promote the event I am organizing
I want to gather contact information for participants
So I can estimate how many people are interested
And to send more information (if any)


## Installation


No installation needed. If cloning repo do an npm install.


## Usage

Event organizers can log in and create events with a time, place, description, and category. 

Event participants do not have to log in and can view all currently active events or filter the list of events by time, place, or category. Participants are also able to become "Watchers" of a given event which will allow them to submit an email address to be used by the event organizer to notify them of any updates to the event.
